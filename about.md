# About me!

![Picture of John Kilpatrick](/assets/img/john.svg){:.avatar}

Hi! I'm John Kilpatrick, a Ph.D. student in structured light group at the [University of Exeter](https://exeter.ac.uk).
I'm bringing bleeding-edge optics to the NHS. 

My supervisors are [Dr. Dave Phillips](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/dp413) and [Prof. Nick Stone](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/ns329).
I recieved a first class MPhys. Physics with Study in New Zealand from Exeter.

### Who's this blog for?

Me!
This is a progress tracker of where I am, and hopefully will help remind my future self of silly mistakes so I don't make them anymore.
Hopefully, the content will vary from physics to GPU-compute.
