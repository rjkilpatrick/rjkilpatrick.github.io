## Year Abroad
As part of my Physics degree, I spent a year at the [University of Otago](https://otago.ac.nz).

## Hobbyist
I am building a Tellytubby T-Shirt. A Pi Zero is the brain, with an 8&quot; LCD stitched on to the front of a T-Shirt

## Programmer
I have many ~~unfinished~~ active projects. Have a look at these on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/rjkilpatrick) account.
