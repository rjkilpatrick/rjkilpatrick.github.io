# Projects
This is my personal to-do list of projects that will be finished
eventually. It makes no attempt to be succinct, but should be readable
(enough).
## Hardware
- ### Tellytubby T-Shirt
  Parses tweets with the handle [@OnTheShirt](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=OnTheShirt)
- ### Smart Mirror
  Initial plan is a website that's hosted on a Pi Zero, integrated
  behind a one-way mirror <!-- TODO: Complete writing section -->
  [here](https://github.com/rjkilpatrick/SmartMirror)

## Software
- ### Physics MediaWiki
  Phyiscs on the internet is normally from a coneptual point, but rarely has step-by-step solved problems.
  Personally, I forget these
  steps and then how to solve problems. It also aims to digitise many paper notes that are occupying too much space at the moment.
- ### App
  Make an app with [flutter](https://flutter.dev). It has a wonderful hot reload feature
- ### Godot
  I'm making a game with Godot, because it's beautiful.

## Misc
- French on Duolingo
